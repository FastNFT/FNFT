/**
 * @brief Enum that specifies discretizations and methods used to compute nonlinear Fourier
 * transforms for the Manakov Equation.
 *
 * Each discretization is always related to a particular numerical method and some
 * are additionally related to a splitting-scheme.\n
 * FTES4_YZ and XSPLITYZ are methods to which an exponential splitting scheme defined by
 * Prins and Wahls, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461708">&quot; Higher Order Exponential
 * Splittings for the Fast Non-Linear Fourier Transform of the Korteweg-De Vries Equation &quot;</a>, Proc. ICASSP 2018,
 * has been applied.\n
 * For FTES4_YZ, the base method is the TES4 method from Medvedev, Vaseva, Chekhovskoy and Fedoruk
 * <a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.377140">&quot; Exponential fourth order schemes for direct Zakharov-Shabat problem &quot;</a>, Optics Express 28(1) 2020.\n
 * For XSPLITYZ X denotes the order of the base method. For X=2 the second order method by Boffetta and Osborne
 * from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(92)90370-E">&quot;Computation of the direct scattering transform for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation &quot;</a>
 * J. Comput. Phys. 102(2), 1992, has been chosen. For X=4 the base method
 * is the fourth order
 * method CF4_2 from Chimmalgi, Prins and Wahls, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945480">&quot;Fast Nonlinear Fourier Transform Algorithms Using Higher Order Exponential Integrators&quot;</a>, IEEE Access (7) 2019.\n
 * For FTES4_YZ and XSPLITYZ, Y denotes the order of the chosen exponential splitting scheme from
 * Prins and Wahls, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461708">&quot;
 * Higher order exponential splittings for the fast non-linear Fourier transform of the KdV equation,&quot;
 * </a>Proc. ICASSP 2018, pp. `z` is type of splitting and
 * can be `A` or `B, with `A` standing for schemes implemented as defined in Prins and Wahls, 
 * <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461708">&quot;
 * Higher order exponential splittings for the fast non-linear Fourier transform of the KdV equation,&quot;
 * </a>Proc. ICASSP 2018, pp. 4524-4528. `B` type of splitting are the same as `A` with the positions of the 
 * two terms in the splitting interchanged.\n
 * FTES4_suzuki is the FTES4 method where suzuki factorization (<a href="https://journals.jps.jp/doi/10.1143/JPSJ.61.3015"> J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. (1992)</a>)
 * was used to split the exponential term, as carried out by Medvedev, Chekhovskoy, Vaseva and Fedoruk in <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-45-7-2082">
 * &quot; Conservative multi-exponential scheme for solving the direct Zakharovâ€“Shabat scattering problem&quot;</a>, Optics Letters 45(7) 2020.\n
 * In general, discretizations with a lower degree are faster, while those with
 * a highter order of accuracy are more accurate. Therefore, the best choice is
 * normally among `-2A`, `-2B`, `-4B`, `-6B`.
 * The choice between these is a trade-off between speed and accuracy.\n
 *
 * Fast discretizations implemented for the Manakov equation: (degree denotes the polynomial degree of a single transition matrix)\n
