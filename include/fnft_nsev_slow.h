 * The accuray of the computed quantities for a given signal depends primarily on the number of samples \f$ D\f$ and the numerical method. When the exact spectrum is 
 * is know, the accuracy can be quantified by defining a suitable error. The error usually decreases with increasing \f$ D\f$ assuming everthing else remains the same. 
 * The rate at which the error decreases with increase in \f$ D\f$ is known as the order of the method. The orders of the various discretizations can be found at \link fnft_nse_discretization_t \endlink.
 * In the following cases the orders of the methods has been observed to be less than expected:
 *       - Focusing case CF4_3, residues have order two instead of four.
 *       - Focusing case CF6_4, residues have order three instead of six.
 *       - Focusing case TES4, residues have order two instead of four.
 *
 * Application of one step Richardson extrapolation should in theory increase the order by one. However, it can deviate both ways. In case of some smooth signals the order
 * may increase by two instead of one. On the other hand for discontinuous signals it maybe deterimental to apply Richardson extrapolation. In the following cases the orders of the methods has been observed to be less than expected:
 *       - Focusing case CF4_3, residues have order two instead of five.
 *       - Focusing case CF5_3, residues have order five instead of six.
 *       - Focusing case CF6_4, residues have order four instead of seven.
 *       - Focusing case TES4, residues have order two instead of five.

 * @param[in] D Number of samples
 * @param[in] q Array of length D, contains samples \f$ q(t_n)=q(x_0, t_n) \f$,
 *  where \f$ t_n = T[0] + n(T[1]-T[0])/(D-1) \f$ and \f$n=0,1,\dots,D-1\f$, of
 *  the to-be-transformed signal in ascending order
 *  (i.e., \f$ q(t_0), q(t_1), \dots, q(t_{D-1}) \f$)
 * @param[in] T Array of length 2, contains the position in time of the first and
 *  of the last sample. It should be \f$T[0]<T[1]\f$).
 * @param[in] M Number of points at which the continuous spectrum (aka
 *  reflection coefficient) should be computed.
 * @param[out] contspec Array of length M in which the routine will store the
 *  desired samples \f$ r(\xi_m) \f$ of the continuous spectrum (aka
 *  reflection coefficient) in ascending order,
 *  where \f$ \xi_m = XI[0]+(XI[1]-XI[0])/(M-1) \f$ and \f$m=0,1,\dots,M-1\f$.
 *  Has to be preallocated by the user. If NULL is passed instead, the
 *  continuous spectrum will not be computed. By changing the options, it is
 *  also possible to compute the values of \f$ a(\xi) \f$ and \f$ b(\xi) \f$
 *  instead. In that case, twice the amount of memory has to be allocated.
 * @param[in] XI Array of length 2, contains the position of the first and the last
 *  sample of the continuous spectrum. It should be \f$XI[0]<XI[1]\f$. Can also be
 *  NULL if contspec==NULL.
 * @param[in,out] K_ptr Upon entry, *K_ptr should contain the length of the array
 *  bound_states. Upon return, *K_ptr contains the number of actually detected
 *  bound states. Note that in order to skip
 *  the computation of the bound states completely, it is not sufficient to pass
 *  *K_ptr==0. Instead, one needs to pass bound_states==NULL.
 * @param[out] bound_states Array. Upon return, the routine has stored the detected
 *  bound states (aka eigenvalues) in the first *K_ptr entries of this array.
 *  If NULL is passed instead, the discrete spectrum will not be computed.
 *  Has to be preallocated by the user. The user can choose an arbitrary
 *  length. Currently only NEWTON method is supported hence bound_states
 *  should contain initial guesses of the bound states.
 * @param[out] normconsts_or_residues Array of the same length as bound_states. Upon
 *  return, the routine has stored the residues (aka spectral amplitudes)
 *  \f$\rho_k = b_k\big/ \frac{da(\lambda_k)}{d\lambda}\f$ in the
 *  first *K_ptr entries of this array. By passing a proper opts, it is also
 *  possible to store the norming constants (the '\f$ b_k \f$') or both. Has to
 *  be pre-allocated by the user. If NULL is passed instead, the residues
 *  will not be computed.
 * @param[in] kappa =+1 for the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation,
 *  =-1 for the defocusing one
 * @param[in] opts Pointer to a \link fnft_nsev_slow_opts_t \endlink object. The object
 *  can be used to modify the behavior of the routine. Use
 *  the routine \link fnft_nsev_slow_default_opts \endlink
 *  to generate such an object and modify as desired. It is also possible to
 *  pass NULL, in which case the routine will use the default options. The
 *  user is reponsible to freeing the object after the routine has returned.
 * @return \link FNFT_SUCCESS \endlink or one of the FNFT_EC_... error codes
 *  defined in \link fnft_errwarn.h \endlink.
