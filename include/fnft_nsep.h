 *
 * @var fnft_nsep_opts_t::max_evals

 *
 * For the Newton refinement mode only, one of the following should be used instead:
 *      - fnft_nse_discretization_BO
 *      - fnft_nse_discretization_CF4_2
 *
 * @param[in] D Number of samples. Should be power of two and \f$ D\geq 2\f$.
 * @param[in] q Array of length D, contains samples \f$ q(t_n)=q(x_0, t_n) \f$,
 *  where \f$ t_n = T[0] + nL/D \f$, where \f$L=T[1]-T[0]\f$ is the period and
 *  \f$n=0,1,\dots,D-1\f$, of the to-be-transformed signal in ascending order
 *  (i.e., \f$ q(t_0), q(t_1), \dots, q(t_{D-1}) \f$)
 * @param[in] T Array of length 2. T[0] is the position in time of the first
 *  sample. T[1] is the beginning of the next period. (The location of the last
 *  sample is thus \f$t_{D-1}=T[1]-L/D\f$.) It should be \f$T[0]<T[1]\f$.
 * @param[in] phase_shift Real scalar constant. It is the change in the phase
 * over one quasi-period,\f$ \angle(q(t+L)/q(t))\f$. For periodic signals it will be 0.
 * @param[in,out] K_ptr Upon entry, *K_ptr should contain the length of the array
 *  main_spec (except for Newton localization, see below). Upon return,
 *  *K_ptr contains the number of actually detected
 *  points in the main spectrum. If the length of the array main_spec was not
 *  sufficient to store all of the detected points in the main spectrum, a
 *  warning is printed and as many points as possible are returned instead.
 *  Note that in order to skip the computation of the main spectrum completely,
 *  it is not sufficient to pass *K_ptr==NULL. Instead, pass main_spec==NULL.
 *  EXCEPTION: If opts->localization==fnft_nsep_loc_NEWTON, then *K_ptr should
 *  contain the number of initial guess per spine point (see opts->points_per_spine).
 * @param[out] main_spec Array. Upon return, the routine has stored the detected
 *  main specrum points (i.e., the points for which the trace of the monodromy
 *  matrix is either +2 or -2) in the first *K_ptr entries of this array.
 *  If NULL is passed instead, the main spectrum will not be computed.
 *  Has to be preallocated by the user. The user can choose an arbitrary
 *  length. Typically, D is a good choice.
 *  If opts->localization==fnft_nsep_loc_NEWTON, then main_spec should be of
 *  the form [g1_1, ..., gK_1, g1_2, ..., gK_2, ..., g1_P, ..., gK_P] when
 *  the routine is called, where gk_n is the k-th initial guess for the n-th
 *  spine point, K=*K_ptr, and P=opts->points_per_spine.
 * @param[in,out] M_ptr Upon entry, *M_ptr should contain the length of the array
 *  aux_spec. Upon return, *M_ptr contains the number of actually detected
 *  points in the auxiliary spectrum. If the length of the array aux_spec was
 *  not sufficient to store all of the detected points in the auxiliary
 *  spectrum, a warning is printed and as many points as possible are returned
 *  instead. Note that in order to skip the computation of the auxiliary
 *  spectrum completely, it is not sufficient to pass *M_ptr==NULL. Instead,
 *  pass aux_spec==NULL.
 * @param[out] aux_spec Array. Upon return, the routine has stored the detected
 *  auxiliary specrum points (i.e., the points for which the upper right
 *  element of the monodromy matrix is zero) in the first *M_ptr entries of
 *  this array. If NULL is passed instead, the auxiliary spectrum will not be
 *  computed. Has to be preallocated by the user. The user can choose an
 *  arbitrary length. Typically, D is a good choice.
 * @param[in] sheet_indices Not yet implemented. Pass NULL.
 * @param[in] kappa =+1 for the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation,
 *  =-1 for the defocusing one.
 * @param[in] opts Pointer to a \link fnft_nsep_opts_t \endlink object. The object
 *  can be used to modify the behavior of the routine. Use
 *  the routine \link fnft_nsep_default_opts \endlink
 *  to generate such an object and modify as desired. It is also possible to
 *  pass NULL, in which case the routine will use the default options. The
 *  user is reponsible to freeing the object after the routine has returned.
 * @return \link FNFT_SUCCESS \endlink or one of the FNFT_EC_... error codes
 *  defined in \link fnft_errwarn.h \endlink.
